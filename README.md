# ML-for-Physicists-PHAS0056
Repository for UCL Module "Machine Learning for Physicists"

In this repository I will upload the coursework material for the module. 

### Week 1
Within this notebook, a first introduction to machine learning was done, by fitting a curve to polynomials using gradient descent.

### Week 2
Within this notebook, different neuralnetworks were created, fine-tuning the various hyperparameters, in order to replicate 3 increasingly complex shapes. 

### Week 3
Within this notebook, a Neural Network was trained on noisy images from the MNIST database to reduce overfitting.
