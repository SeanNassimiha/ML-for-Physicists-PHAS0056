# ML-for-Physicists-PHAS0056
Repository for UCL Module "Machine Learning for Physicists"

In this repository I will upload the coursework material for the module. 

### Week 1

Notebook: CurveFitting.ipynb

Within this notebook, a first introduction to machine learning was done, by fitting a curve to polynomials using gradient descent.

### Week 2

Notebook: hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb

Within this notebook, different neuralnetworks were created, fine-tuning the various hyperparameters, in order to replicate 3 increasingly complex shapes. 

### Week 3

Notebook: MNIST_training_on_noisyImg.ipynb

Within this notebook, a Neural Network was trained on noisy images from the MNIST database to reduce overfitting. 

### Week 4

Notebooks: MNIST_CNN.ipynb , Autoencoder.ipynb

Within these two notebooks, I will:
  - Build a CNN for MNIST digit recognition, first with only one convolutional layer, and then with as many as needed.
  - Build an autoencoder for a circle image, first with a 9-nodes bottleneck, and then with a 3-nodes bottleneck.
