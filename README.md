# ML for Physicists PHAS0056
Repository for UCL Module "Machine Learning for Physicists"

In this repository I will upload the coursework material for the module. 

### Week 1: Curve Fitting

[Notebook](https://github.com/SeanNassimiha/ML-for-Physicists-PHAS0056/blob/main/CurveFitting.ipynb)

Within this notebook, a first introduction to machine learning was done, by fitting a curve to polynomials using gradient descent.

### Week 2: Hyperparameter Tuning

[Notebook](https://github.com/SeanNassimiha/ML-for-Physicists-PHAS0056/blob/main/hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb)

Within this notebook, different neuralnetworks were created, fine-tuning the various hyperparameters, in order to replicate 3 increasingly complex shapes. 

### Week 3: Training on Noisy Images

[Notebook](https://github.com/SeanNassimiha/ML-for-Physicists-PHAS0056/blob/main/MNIST_training_on_noisyImg.ipynb)

Within this notebook, a Neural Network was trained on noisy images from the MNIST database to reduce overfitting. 

### Week 4: CNNs for MNIST and Autoencoders

[Notebook 1](https://github.com/SeanNassimiha/ML-for-Physicists-PHAS0056/blob/main/MNIST_CNN.ipynb) and 
[Notebook 2](https://github.com/SeanNassimiha/ML-for-Physicists-PHAS0056/blob/main/Autoencoder.ipynb)

Within these two notebooks, I will:
  - Build a CNN for MNIST digit recognition, first with only one convolutional layer, and then with as many as needed.
  - Build an autoencoder for a circle image, first with a 9-nodes bottleneck, and then with a 3-nodes bottleneck. 

### Week 5: PCA and MNIST

[Notebook](https://github.com/SeanNassimiha/ML-for-Physicists-PHAS0056/blob/main/PCA_and_MNIST.ipynb)

Within this notebook, different neural network were trained on the MNIST dataset, each created using N PCA components, and were then evaluated on the test_set over an array of different PCA components. 

### Week 6: LSTM and a Double Pendulum

[Notebook](https://github.com/SeanNassimiha/ML-for-Physicists-PHAS0056/blob/main/LSTM_DoublePendulum.ipynb)

Within this notebook, we will use a LSTM (a form of RNN) to predict the movement of a (chaotic) double pendulum a certain number of steps in the future.
